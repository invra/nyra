= Building Nyra on Windows (Terminal)

== Repository
Clone the link:../../[Nyra GitLab] repository.

== Dependencies

You still need Visual Studio installed because Windows relies on its build tools and SDKs.  
Make sure the following are installed:

* link:https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/[Visual Studio 2022 (or newer)]
* link:https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks?cid=getdotnetsdk[.NET 10.0 Visual Studio SDK]
* link:https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net481-developer-pack-offline-installer[.NET Framework 4.8.1 Developer Pack]

NOTE: Even if you do not plan to open Visual Studio, it must be installed for its build toolchain.

== Configure

Nyra requires a configuration file before it can run.  
Copy the provided `.env.example` file and fill in your bot details (Discord token, prefix, etc.):

[source,powershell]
----
copy .env.example .env
----

== Build

From a **Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio** or any shell where `dotnet` is available:

. Restore dependencies:
+
[source,powershell]
----
dotnet restore nyra.slnx
----

. Build the solution:
+
[source,powershell]
----
dotnet build nyra.slnx
----

. Run the project:
+
[source,powershell]
----
dotnet run --project nyra.slnx
----

The bot will compile and start from the terminal.  
Compiled binaries are located in `bin\Debug\net10.0\`.

== Troubleshooting

If you encounter build errors:

=== Error: "The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET 10.0."

This usually means your SDK is outdated or the wrong `dotnet` binary is being used.

* Verify your version:
  [source,powershell]
  ----
  dotnet --version
  ----
* Ensure the Visual Studio .NET 10 SDK is installed and prioritized.

=== Error: "No BOT_PREFIX variable found in the ENV" or "No DISCORD_TOKEN variable found in the ENV"

These errors indicate Nyra cannot find required environment variables.

* Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains valid values.
* The `.env` must be in the project root alongside `nyra.slnx`.
