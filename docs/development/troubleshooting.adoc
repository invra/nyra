= Troubleshooting build failures

If the build fails, here are some common issues and solutions.

=== Error: "The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET 10.0."

This means your SDK version is out of date or the wrong `dotnet` binary is being used.  

* Ensure .NET 10.0 is installed correctly.  
* Check your `PATH` and make sure the .NET 10 binary is prioritized.  

=== Error: "No BOT_PREFIX variable found in the ENV" or "No DISCORD_TOKEN variable found in the ENV"

These errors indicate Nyra cannot find required environment variables.  

Solution: Copy the example configuration file and fill in the required values:
[source,shell]
----
cp .env.example .env
