= Building Nyra on a Normal System

. Enter the Nix development environment:
+
[source,shell]
----
nix develop
----

. Restore dependencies:
+
[source,shell]
----
dotnet restore
----

. Run the project:
+
[source,shell]
----
dotnet run
----

The development environment will override your `PATH` and provide the correct .NET 10 SDK, so the build should succeed without extra configuration.
