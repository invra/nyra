= Building Nyra on a POSIX-Compliant System

== Repository
Clone the link:../../[Nyra GitLab] repository.

== Dependencies

Before building, make sure you have:

* link:https://nixos.org/download/[Nix]

NOTE: Nix provides the development environment and ensures the correct .NET SDK is available.

== Configure

Nyra requires a configuration file before it can run.  
Copy the provided `.env.example` and update it with your bot details (Discord token, prefix, etc.):

[source,shell]
----
cp .env.example .env
----

== Build

. Enter the Nix development environment:
+
[source,shell]
----
nix develop
----

. Restore dependencies:
+
[source,shell]
----
dotnet restore
----

. Run the project:
+
[source,shell]
----
dotnet run
----

The development environment will override your `PATH` and provide the correct .NET 10 SDK, so the build should succeed without extra configuration.

== Troubleshooting

If the build does not succeed:

* Verify that you are inside the Nix development environment (`nix develop` must be run first).  
* Confirm `.NET 10` is available by running:
  [source,shell]
  ----
  dotnet --version
  ----
* Ensure your `.env` file exists in the project root and contains valid values.
