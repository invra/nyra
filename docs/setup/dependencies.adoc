= Nyra's Dependencies

There is two sections, one for Nix, and one for General systems. If you are able to use Nix, and dont have grudge about it
I would highly recommend Nix for this project.

== Nix Dev Environment

The Nix way is really helpful, as all you have to do is

[source, shell]
----
nix develop
----

and then you will have everything.

== Other systems

The list of prerequisites is:
* https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/[The Rust Toolchain]
* https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0[.NET 10 (10.0.0-rc.1 or later)]

=== Turning on stuff in Visual Studio (Windows only)

. Open **Visual Studio 2022** (or newer)
. Go to `Tools` > `Options`
