= Nyra

An open-source Discord bot built with *Discord.Net*.

---

== Why Nyra?

This project exists for two main reasons:

1. To refresh my C# skills after a ~5–6 year break on it.
2. To evaluate whether C# is a language I’d enjoy working with again.

---

== Getting Started

Start by copying the environment template and setting up your secrets:

[source,shell]
----
$ cp .env.example .env
----

Then edit `.env` and add your bot token and any other necessary settings

---

== Supported Platforms

Nyra has been tested and confirmed working on:

* Linux (any distro with `/etc/os-release` and its `PRETTY_NAME` key)
* FreeBSD
* macOS
* Windows (7 through 11; assumed to be compatible across all)

---

== Building & Running

Nyra targets **.NET 10.0** as the minimum runtime requirement.

=== Visual Studio (Windows)

If you're using Visual Studio on Windows, follow these setup steps:

1. **Install the .NET 10.0 SDK**
   Download the appropriate SDK from link:https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks?cid=getdotnetsdk[here].

2. **Install .NET Framework 4.8.1 Developer Pack**
   Required for certain internal tooling. Download it link:https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net481-developer-pack-offline-installer[here].

3. **Enable SDK Previews in Visual Studio**

   * Open Visual Studio 2022 (or newer)
   * Go to `Tools` > `Options`

   * Expand `Environment` > `Preview Features`
   * Enable **"Use previews of the .NET SDK"**
   * Click OK and restart Visual Studio

After completing these steps, you should be ready to build and run the bot.

=== Other (normal) systems

To run from the terminal:

```shell
$ dotnet restore
$ dotnet run
```

* `dotnet restore` pulls in NuGet dependencies
* `dotnet run` compiles and launches the bot
