= Nyra

An open-source Discord bot built with *Discord.Net*.

== Why Nyra?

This project exists for two main reasons:

. To refresh my rusty C# knowledge from ~5–6 years ago.
. To see if C# is a language I’d endulge again.

== Getting Started

First, copy the environment template and configure your secrets:

[source,shell]
----
$ cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env with your token and other settings
----

== Supported Systems

Nyra has been tested on the following platforms:

* [x] Linux (any with `/etc/os-release` with `PRETTY_NAME`)
* [x] FreeBSD
* [x] macOS
* [x] Windows (7–11, theoretically compatible)

== Compilation & Running

Nyra targets the `net9.0` runtime as a minimum requirement.

To build and run:

[source,shell]
----
dotnet restore
dotnet run
----

The first command fetches dependencies from NuGet, and the second compiles and executes the bot.

== License

This project’s code is licensed under link:./LICENSE.txt[the Unlicense].

Essentially, this means you can do almost anything you want with it — see <https://unlicense.org> for details.
